# LOX Lang
LOX is very close to Javascript and C and the Closuers look something
like "Scheme"? Never heard of this before.

Let's dig into a little cooler features.

## Dynamic Typing
hi, meet `itr`. `itr = 5`, itr is an int. Now, `itr="hello"` it's a string now.
God I hate it. Well, you hate what you don't understand. So it's high
time to demystify.

Oh well, it looks like static systems are harder to implement.

## Garbage Collection
And here I thought eckard told me to clean my own shit.
- refernce counting -> We did that in our OS (wohooo)
- tracing garbage collection

Another thing I hate that I will come to understand.
Bring it right up baby.

## Data Types
Below are the datatypes we will be building to our language:
- Boolean
- Numbers -> int and float I guess
- Strings
- Nil -> Superuseful for our Dynamically typed language huh

## Expressions
below are the expressions which will be supported by this language
- Arithmetic
